# Patient Condition NLP Project

## Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patient condition data and extract meaningful insights. The dataset used in this project is `drugsComTrain.tsv`, which contains drug reviews and associated patient conditions.

## Project Files

- **`drugsComTrain.tsv`** - The dataset containing drug reviews, ratings, conditions, and other metadata.
- **`patient_condition_nlp_project_tutorial.ipynb`** - A Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to process and analyze the dataset.

## Objectives

- Perform text preprocessing on drug reviews.
- Apply NLP techniques to extract key insights from patient reviews.
- Identify patterns in drug effectiveness based on patient conditions.
- Develop a machine learning model to classify patient conditions or predict drug effectiveness.

## Dependencies

To run this project, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository (if applicable).**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**  
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `patient_condition_nlp_project_tutorial.ipynb`:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Execute the cells sequentially to load and process the dataset.

## Expected Outputs

- Data visualization showing the distribution of patient conditions and drug effectiveness.
- Preprocessed text data ready for modeling.
- Machine learning model trained to classify conditions or predict drug effectiveness.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement deep learning models for improved classification.
- Incorporate additional datasets to enhance analysis.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.
