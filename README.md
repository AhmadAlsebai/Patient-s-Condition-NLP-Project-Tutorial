# Patient Condition NLP Project

## Overview

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patient condition data and extract meaningful insights. The dataset used in this project is `drugsComTrain.tsv`, which contains drug reviews and associated patient conditions.

## Project Files

- `drugsComTrain.tsv` - The dataset containing drug reviews, ratings, conditions, and other metadata.
- `patient_condition_nlp_project_tutorial.ipynb` - A Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to process and analyze the dataset.

## Objectives

- Perform text preprocessing on drug reviews.
- Apply NLP techniques to extract key insights from patient reviews.
- Identify patterns in drug effectiveness based on patient conditions.
- Develop a machine learning model to classify patient conditions or predict drug effectiveness.

## Dependencies

To run this project, install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
